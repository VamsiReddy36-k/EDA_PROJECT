# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Phase 1 & Phase 2

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** performed in two structured phases to understand, clean, and analyze the dataset effectively. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and prepare the data for further modeling or business decision-making.

The analysis is implemented using **Python** in a Jupyter Notebook environment and follows industry-standard data analysis practices.
